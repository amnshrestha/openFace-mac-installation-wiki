# Facial Action Coding System

![Examples of Action Units](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/images/AUs.jpg)

Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system to taxonomize human facial movements by their appearance on the face. Movements of individual facial muscles are encoded by FACS from slight different instant changes in facial appearance. Using FACS it is possible to code nearly any anatomically possible facial expression, deconstructing it into the specific Action Units (AU) that produced the expression. It is a common standard to objectively describe facial expressions. 

OpenFace is able to recognize a subset of AUs, specifically: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 26, 28, and 45.

You can find more details about FACS and AUs [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System) and [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~face/facs.htm)

- Extraction from images and extraction from videos

- Static vs dynamic

- How they are trained and where the instructions for training are
