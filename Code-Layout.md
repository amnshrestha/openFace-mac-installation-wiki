- `./lib`
   - `local` - the actual meat of the code where the relevant computer vision algorithms reside
      - `CppInterop` - wrappers around C++ code for C# bindings
      - `LandmarkDetector` - The CE-CLM, CLNF, and CLM algorithms together with face tracking code
      - `FaceAnalyser` - Facial Action Unit detection and some useful code for extracting features for facial analysis
	  - `GazeAnalyser` - Code for extracting eye gaze
