# Outline

The Point Distribution Model (PDM) is a way to parametrise the shape of a face using a limited set of parameters. In our case the PDM is made up of two terms, rigid and non-rigid shape parameters. Rigid shape parameters describe the placement of the face in the image --- scaling, rotation, and translation. Non-rigid shape parameters on the other hand describe the deformation of the face due to identity or expression, e.g. wider or taller faces, smiles, blinks etc.
